**OVERVIEW**

This repository was made for a Web Technologies Project by Michael Mortty. The goal of the project is to create a RESTful API that retires user data with the help of Node JS, Express and Postman. During the process, I learned a lot about the fs module, the many uses of the terminal of VS code such as creating a repository and uploading files to it and also using it to install Express. 

**TEAM**

It was hard, amidst all the other projects piled on us but we pi=ulled through and learned alot from it.
All this would not have been possible if not for the help of my team;
Bill Amegah - debugger and error fixing
Maame Yaa Appiah- tester
Maame Araba Amoah - tester
Chidiebele Amechi - server creation
Michael Mortty -  server creation
and a very generous senior.
